# Deep-Learning-with-Yolov2-for-Object-Detection
We explore machine learning for image classification, using a camera to capture and classify images of objects like oranges and apples. This demonstrates how classification models can enhance pick-and-place operations in industrial robots, showcasing practical applications of machine learning in automating industrial processes.
